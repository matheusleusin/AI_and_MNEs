The paper abstract is:
*This paper investigates how the development of AI-related inventions by Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) affects their technological trajectories and innovative performance. I combine a matched-pair analysis with an extension of the Difference-in-Difference method to analyse these effects over a novel panel dataset of MNEs. This dataset links over 30 thousand MNEs to more than 10 million patents that these companies owned directly or indirectly (i.e., through their subsidiaries) in the period from 2011 to 2019. The results indicate that MNEs introducing AI-related inventions increase the relatedness of subsequent inventions by about 10 per cent compared to a control group. These results are robust when accounting for a self-selection bias. AI is thus being used to reinforce the existing technological trajectories, rather than to disrupt them. The results also suggest that the number of subsequent inventions is about 40 per cent higher for MNEs that introduce AI during the observation period compared to the control group, without significant effects on the intensity of R&D expenditures per invention. It is argued that this increase in innovative performance is linked not only to knowledge dynamics created by learning about AI but also by AIâ€™s technical potential to be used for learning.*

The repository contains an R code and all the data necessary to estimate all the effects of AI adoption presented in the paper. 

The data used to make these estimates comes from Bureau van Dijk's (Bvd) intellectual property via their Orbis and Orbis IP databases. For that reason, the data presented here is a simplified version in which key variables are omitted,e.g., BvD_Ids of companies, which is BvD's proprietary identifier. The data is based instead on ids generated to replace this BvD_Id information. Companies' names are also omitted. Moreover, the IDs generated are based on the matched results of controls and treated companies. The matching procedure is presented in the paper (see section "3.2. Matching AI Adopters to Non-adopters"). In it, some control companies can be combined more than once to treated companies, meaning that some distinct ids may refer to the same company matched more than 1 time (this happens for roughly less than 5% of the companies).

Two files from the [Data folder](https://github.com/matheusleusin/AI_and_MNEs/tree/main/Data) are used to reproduce the entire code:
*Data_matched_MNEs.csv* - This data file contains information about the generated ids, the calculated relatedness, NACE sectors, and other MNE-specific indicators used to make the estimations. The time range goes from 2006 to 2019. This data file looks like this:

*SquareMatrixSectors.csv* - This data file presents a square matrix linking NACE sectors to the number of patents identified as registered by any company of these sectors for any 4-digits IPC code. The file looks like this:

Two additional files are generated by running the code: *Distance_categories.csv* and *Distance_categories2.csv*. They refer  respectively to an intermediary and to the final estimation of technological distance from distinct NACE sectors to the cluster of AI technologies.
